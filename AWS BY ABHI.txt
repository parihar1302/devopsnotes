******VPC (virtual private cloud)

1.)  YOUR INSTANCE IS INTRACTING WITH INTERNET THAT CALLED vpc PUBLIC Susbnet

2.)  SOME INSTANCES HAVE INTRACTION AND SOME DNT HV ACCESS TO INTERNET Called vpc WITH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SUBNETS

note:- hardwarde tenancy= (I.) dedecated means hardware will be using by you only
                          cost will be too high
                          (II.) default means har will be hardware will be shard by u.

*** NAT instance are responsible to give internet access to my private instances.

* public subnet- hosting server- webserver which hosting the data traffic from outside internet 

**  Public route table - it consist how does public subnet will intract with internet
                         It gets interent connection through internetGateway

* private subnet- db serevr which used to post the data traffic

**   private route table - it consist info. that how NAT gateway will intract with private subnet server

Q.) Directly can we give internet access to Private Route Table
A.) No! WITH THE HELP OF NAT IS POSSIBLE
arechiteure:-  internet gateway(like router)---Public Route Table-----Web Server

Q.) when u launch VPC what  resoures do u get by default?
A.) Main route table

* Route Table:- Main route table will be present by default
   
    add route- 0.0.0.0/0 to allow all inetrent connection to come to your InternetGateway.

* internet Gateway:- Like a router a VPC has only 1 Internet Gate

* Private route table set as main route table

* NACL (network access control list)act as a FIREWALL
